# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> While reading the code helps at some level, the comments and documentation do not help learn the inner connections of the API. While I did not search the internet at all for help on using this API, the examples provided contributed greatly to my learning. Through examples and use cases I was able to better understand the intent of use of the function, and surprisingly I better understood how inside functions worked together as well after reading the examples. I feel as though understanding this API would have been much, much easier if the public API functions had some high level abstraction comments, as I had the feeling I was going in blind when trying to begin to interpret the API functionality.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> To me, raising the level of abstraction with regards to writing comments means write comments that tell what a segment of code does without addressing the logic of the code. I would tell CS142 students that an effective comment tells a lay person what the code does without the need for them to understand the programming language.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 3 hours


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Instructions are a little vague in terms of whether or not you should comment non export functions period.
